# Psychic-Game
Psychic-Game is a game where you guess the letter that the computer is thinking of. I have used Bootstrap to style the game. This game was 
built using html and javascript.
# How to play
1. Press the letter key of your choice.
2. If your choice matches the computer's choice, you win! and the game resets.
3. If your choice doesn't match the computer's choice, you lose, the computer wins! and the game resets.
4. In each round, you are allowed 14 guesses. The game will reset once you've used all your guesses.
